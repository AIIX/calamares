# 3.3.0 (unreleased) #

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - No external contributors yet

## Core ##
 - KDE Framework "DBusAddons" is now required, and is used to "activate"
   Calamares; the KDAB Single Application Guard is no longer used.
   KDSAG needed patching to chase Qt 5.15 deprecations, and the DBus
   activation code is tried and tested in Frameworks (tier 1).
   Running `calamares -d` no longer enforces a single-application
   (it is for debugging purposes, after all).

## Modules ##
 - No module changes yet
