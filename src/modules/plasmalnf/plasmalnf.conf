# For systems where the user Calamares runs as (usually root,

# You can limit the list of Plasma look-and-feel themes by listing ids
# here. If this key is not present, or the list is empty, all of the
# installed themes are listed. If only one theme is listed, why are
# you using this module at all? Themes may be listed by id,
# (e.g. fluffy-bunny, below) or as a theme and an image (e.g. breeze)
# which will be used to show a screenshot.
