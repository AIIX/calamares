# openrc services module to modify service runlevels via rc-update in the chroot
#
# Services can be added (to any runlevel, or multiple runlevels) or deleted.
# Handle del with care and only use it if absolutely necessary.
#
# if a service is listed in the conf but is not present/detected on the target system,
# or a runlevel does not exist, it will be ignored and skipped; a warning is logged.

# services: each subkey of *services* is an action to take;
# supported actions are "add" and "del". The each subkey
# has a list of entries as value, and each entry has two
# fields:
#   - name: the service name
#   - runlevel: can hold any runlevel present on the target system
#
# # Example services:
# services:
#     add:
#         - name: foo1
#           runlevel: default
#         - name: foo2
#           runlevel: nonetwork
#     del:
#         - name: foo3
#           runlevel: default
services: []
