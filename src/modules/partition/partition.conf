# Make sure an autogenerated swap partition is big enough for hibernation in
# automated partitioning modes. Swap can be disabled through *neverCreateSwap*.
#
#  - *neverCreateSwap* is true: no swap is created
#  - *neverCreateSwap* is false (the default): swap is created, as follows:
#    - *ensureSuspendToDisk* is true (default): Swap is always at least total
#      memory size, and up to 4GiB RAM follows the rule-of-thumb 2 * memory;
#      from 4GiB to 8 GiB it stays steady at 8GiB, and over 8 GiB memory
#      swap is the size of main memory.
#    - *ensureSuspendToDisk* is false: Follows the rules above, but Swap is at
#      most 8GiB, and no more than 10% of available disk.
#    In both cases, a fudge factor (usually 10% extra) is applied so that there
#    is some space for administrative overhead (e.g. 8 GiB swap will allocate
#    8.8GiB on disk in the end).
#
# Default is true.

# Never create swap partitions in automated partitioning modes.
# If this is true, ensureSuspendToDisk is ignored.
# Default is false.

# Default filesystem type, used when a "new" partition is made.
#
# When replacing a partition, the existing filesystem inside the
# partition is retained. In other cases, e.g. Erase and Alongside,
# as well as when using manual partitioning and creating a new
# partition, this filesystem type is pre-selected. Note that
# editing a partition in manual-creation mode will not automatically
# change the filesystem type to this default value -- it is not
# creating a new partition.
#
# Suggested values: ext2, ext3, ext4, reiser, xfs, jfs, btrfs
# If nothing is specified, Calamares defaults to "ext4".

# Show/hide LUKS related functionality in automated partitioning modes.
# Disable this if you choose not to deploy early unlocking support in GRUB2
# and/or your distribution's initramfs solution.
#
# BIG FAT WARNING:
#
# This option is unsupported, as it cuts out a crucial security feature.
# Disabling LUKS and shipping Calamares without a correctly configured GRUB2
# and initramfs is considered suboptimal use of the Calamares software. The
# Calamares team will not provide user support for any potential issue that
# may arise as a consequence of setting this option to false.
# It is strongly recommended that system integrators put in the work to support
# LUKS unlocking support in GRUB2 and initramfs/dracut/mkinitcpio/etc.
# Support is offered to system integrators that wish to do so, through the
# Calamares bug tracker, as well as in #calamares on Freenode.
# For more information on setting up GRUB2 for Calamares with LUKS, see
# https://github.com/calamares/calamares/wiki/Deploy-LUKS
