# The starting timezone (e.g. the pin-on-the-map) when entering
# the locale page can be set through keys *region* and *zone*.
# If either is not set, defaults to America/New_York.
#
region:                     "America"
zone:                       "New_York"

# Some distros come with a meaningfully commented and easy to parse
# `/etc/locale.gen`, and others ship a separate file
# `/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED` with a clean list of supported locales.
# We first try SUPPORTED, and if it doesn't exist, we fall back
# to parsing the lines from `locale.gen`. For distro's that ship
# the `locale.gen` file installed elsewhere, the key *localeGenPath*
# can be used to specify where it is. If not set, the default
# `/etc/locale.gen` is used.
#
#localeGenPath:             "/etc/locale.gen"

# GeoIP settings. Leave commented out to disable GeoIP.
#
# An HTTP request is made to *geoipUrl* -- prior to Calamares 3.1.13,
# an implicit "/json" was added at the end.. The request must return
# valid JSON data in the FreeGeoIP format; there should
# be an attribute *time_zone*, with a string value set to the
# timezone, in <region>/<zone> format.
#
# Note that this example URL works, but the service is shutting
# down in June 2018.
#
# Suitable data looks like
# ```
#    {"time_zone":"America/New_York"}
# ```
#
#geoipUrl:                  "freegeoip.net/json"
