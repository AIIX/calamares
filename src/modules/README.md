Calamares modules directory
===

Calamares modules are plugins that implement the Calamares module API and can provide features like installer pages, batch jobs, etc.
To add a module, put it in a subdirectory and make sure it has a CMakeLists.txt, it should be picked up automatically by our CMake magic.
